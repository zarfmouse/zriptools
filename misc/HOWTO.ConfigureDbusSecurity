In order to open up a security policy hole for the dbus service
provided by this package you need to copy the included configuration
file into dbus's configuration and then send a HUP to the system dbus
daemon.

# cp us.zarfmouse.ZRipTools.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d
# ps auxww | grep dbus-daemon | grep system
104       1266  0.0  0.0  24812  2348 ?        Ss   23:11   0:00 /usr/bin/dbus-daemon --system
# kill -1 1266

Where 1266 is replaced by whatever the actual PID of the system dbus daemon is.
